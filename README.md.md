## Yummy Tummy Community for Recipe Sharing app

This is Milestone Project for the Data centric part of the Full Stack Diploma from Code Institute. 
This project/repositary contains the code for a platform/application to store and share recipes. Users will be able to add, modify, delete recipes, categorise them and do basic searches. This application has mainly been built using technologies as Python and the Flask framework.

This app has been built with materialize css to be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes. 
Here are some Wireframes that I worked on initially when I started the project:
